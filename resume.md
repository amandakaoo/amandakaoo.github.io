## About

A senior student majoring in Geography with GIS track at the University of Washington. Although I'm kind of late to join this field and found out the interest in it, working hard to advance my knowledge and skills in GIS. It's never too late to learn. I am patient and hard-working, having the passion to discover the things that happened around the world. I love traveling.
